# Small-Basket Android Application

Small Basket is an Android Application which is use to purchase some grocery item where shopkeeper upload the available items and user can obtain it.

Customers can create their Accounts and with that credentials they can log in and acquire whatever they wants...For that I have used Firebase Database.

Admin also have an account and with specific credential he can log in and perform specific task like he can add new product, modify product and verify new orders.

Customer can search product by Product name , Customer can recover their password by answering some security questions and Customer can see cart (whatever) they have ordered.
